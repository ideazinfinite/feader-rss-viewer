feader-rss-viewer
=================

Chrome browser extension that displays RSS feeds in a small desktop notification styled window, keeps you current while keeping you productive. Now with Pocket(R) (earlier Read it Later) support!

Feader displays to you RSS feeds that you choose from your favorite content sites and displays them in the form of desktop notifications. This extension is really handy when you want to stay up-to-date with the sites you wish to but find it hard to take time out from your busy schedule to exclusively visit them. This brings articles right to your desktop.
